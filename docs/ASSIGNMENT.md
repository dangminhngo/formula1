## Overview:

- Write a webpage that displays content crawled from the F1 racing results at RACE RESULTS (formula1.com)
- Development should be done using TypeScript/React!
- Extra points for using three.js for graphic representation.

## Preparation:

- Candidates should use their skills to retrieve and save the content from the F1 racing result page.
- The format of saving the crawled results can be chosen according to the candidate's preference.

## Webpage Content:

- The webpage should be made so that users can search for contents by year, driver, team, race, etc., using the results of the crawling.
- The UI and search conditions should be structured so that users can intuitively understand and use.
- The result should be composed in various ways, including not only text but also graphs (like the yearly ranking of specific teams/drivers, etc.).

## Deliverables:

- Upload all sources to Github and submit the Github URL
- Actively use branches/merges to demonstrate Git proficiency
- Describe the implemented contents and how to run them in README.md

## Evaluation:

- The program will be run based on what is described in Github to check the implemented results
- If the Github description is insufficient and the program doesn't run, it will be disqualified in the evaluation

## Reference:

- You are allowed to apply your own ideas/design in addition to the above
- Don't create a too complicated and large deliverable - recommend a program size that can be developed in about 10~20 hours with the applicant's ability
